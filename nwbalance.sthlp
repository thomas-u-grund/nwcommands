{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:nwbalance} evaluates a {help netname:network}'s ties as signed (positive/negative) and tests
every closed triad against Cartwright and Harary's (1956) strong structural balance criterion: a
closed triad is {it:balanced} when the product of its three tie values is positive - equivalently,
when it contains an even number (0 or 2) of negative ties ("the friend of my friend is my friend";
"the enemy of my enemy is my friend"). A triad with an odd number (1 or 3) of negative ties is
{it:unbalanced}.

{pstd}
Ties do not need to be declared {help nwvalue:signed} in any special way - any tie with a negative
value is treated as negative, any positive value as positive.

{pstd}
For each node, {cmd:nwbalance} generates the number of closed triads it belongs to, the number of
those that are balanced, and the ratio of the two. Network-level counts and the overall balance
ratio are returned in {help return:r()}.

{pstd}
Of the 4 triads in this network, {it:A-B-C} (all positive) and {it:A-B-D} (two negative ties) are
balanced; {it:A-C-D} and {it:B-C-D} (one negative tie each) are not.
